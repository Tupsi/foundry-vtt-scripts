## Combat Maneuvers
Need the following:

- Ressource 2
- modules
  - Advances Macros
  - Midi-QOL
  - DAE
  - Warpgate
  - CE
  - Sequencer
  - [JB2A animations](https://www.patreon.com/JB2A)

The Combat Superiority item adds and names Ressource 2 automatically. 
Check the Details page of each Feature to see what else you have to configure.
Some Features need the macros from this directory, so put these in your macro folder as well.

I replaces all item images with the standard dice symbol. If you want something more fitting
have a look at [game-icons.net](https://game-icons.net/).

## Known issues
Currently does not work well if the actor also has Lucky as only one button is shown.
